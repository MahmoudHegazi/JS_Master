# JS_Master
This is for training, I used what I learned recently and added them all in one JS file that takes just 0.5400000372901559 ms to display the page and do a lot of JS codes (create 4 paragraphs, then append it to DocumentFragment () then create a div and append DocumentFragment to it, I also created (first post Switch (toggle) built in the world with 0 and 1 I created from the beginning I can copy logic very easily but I did not do it which is better, faster and easy to understood by the browser) Hide / show p , I used performance.now() in order to test the render time
